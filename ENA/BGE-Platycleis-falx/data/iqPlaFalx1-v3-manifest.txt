DESCRIPTION	'PacBio HiFi data for Platycleis was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726) in Hi-C mode. The resulting collapsed p_ctg assembly was used as input to the NBIS/Earth-Biogenome-Project-pilot for contamination screening with FCS-GX, haplotig purging with purge_dups, and scaffolding with YaHS. The Hi-C contact maps were generated with sanger-tol/curationpretext and manual curation was done with PretextView (version 1.0.3) and GRIT_Rapid (git: 1a3d79a8). The assembly coverage is 89x for PacBio HiFi and 66x for Illumina Hi-C.'
