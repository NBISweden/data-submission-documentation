ASSEMBLYNAME	gfCryBron1.1
ASSEMBLY_TYPE	isolate
COVERAGE	36
PROGRAM		Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r639), NBIS/Earth-Biogenome-Project-pilot (version: 27c0a0c8d9), FCS-GX (version 0.5.4), purge_dups (version 1.2.5), YaHS (version 1.2a.2), sanger-tol/curationpretext (version 1.4.2), PretextView (v1.5.0-g5fd8e6e), sanger-tol/agp-tpf-utils (version 1.2.3), PretextViewAI (version: 1.0.5)
PLATFORM	PacBio, Illumina
MINGAPLENGTH	100
MOLECULETYPE	genomic DNA
DESCRIPTION	'PacBio HiFi data downsampled to roughly 38x coverage. The assembly was produced with hifiasm, decontaminated with FCS-GX, haplotigs removed with purge_dups, and scaffolded with YaHS. Curation was done on PretextViewAI with maps obtained from the sanger-tol/curationpretext pipeline, later edited with scripts from sanger-tol/pretextview and sanger-tol/agp-tpf-utils. The assembly coverage is 36x for PacBio HiFi and 180x for Illumina Hi-C.'
