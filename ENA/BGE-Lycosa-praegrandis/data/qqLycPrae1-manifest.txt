DESCRIPTION	'Lycosa praegrandis was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726). Contaminations were removed with FCS-GX (version 0.5.5), sanger-tol/blobtoolkit (version 0.9.0) and tiara (version 1.0.3). Haplotypic duplications were removed with purge_dups (version 1.2.5). Scaffolding was done with Yahs (version 1.2.2). Manual curation was done with PretextView (version 1.0.3) and visually inspected with PretextViewAI (version 1.0.5). It was not possible to determine the sex chromosomes in the assembly.'
