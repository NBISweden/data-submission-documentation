SAMPLE: ERS17850496
ASSEMBLYNAME: hifiasm-gfPorChry1
ASSEMBLY_TYPE: isolate
COVERAGE: 135
PROGRAM: hifiasm (0.19.4-r575)
PLATFORM: PacBio
MOLECULETYPE: genomic DNA
DESCRIPTION: Assembly was carried out with Hifiasm (0.19.4-r575) and haplotypic duplication was identified and removed with purge_dups (1.2.5). The assembly was checked for contaminations with BlobToolKit (4.1.7). Error polishing of homozygous errors was done with DeepVariant (1.5.0). The gene annotation was carried out with Braker (3.0.3).
