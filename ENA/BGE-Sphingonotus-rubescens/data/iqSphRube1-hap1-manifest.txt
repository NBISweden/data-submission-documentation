DESCRIPTION	'Sphingonotus rubescens was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726) in HiC phasing mode. For each haplotype purge_dups (version 1.2.6), FCS-GX (version 0.5.5) based on the ALL database released on 2023/01 and yahs was run separately. When running purge_dups with default parameter 545Mb (hap1) and 746Mb (hap2) of sequence was removed. This also resulted in the loss of several busco genes. Therefore first: contigs larger than 1Mb and second: contigs that were marked as hap but contained single Busco genes were kept. The purge_dups bed annotations was later used in the manual curation step too, in order to decide if a REPEAT tagged contig needs to be removed. The manual curation revealed many haplotype misplacements and HapHic (version 1.0.7) was used to guide those corrections. The X chromosome was identified by aligning both haplotypes to the Schistocerca gregaria assembly (GCA_023897955.2)'
