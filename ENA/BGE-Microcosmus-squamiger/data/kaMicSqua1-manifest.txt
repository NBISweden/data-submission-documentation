DESCRIPTION	'Microcosmus squamiger was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726). Contaminations were removed with FCS-GX (version 0.5.5) based on the ALL database released on 2023/01. Remaining haplotypic duplications were identified with purge_dups (version 1.2.6). The scaffolding was done manually in the curation step. The manual curation was done with PretextView (version 1.0.3) and GRIT_Rapid (git: 1a3d79a8).'
