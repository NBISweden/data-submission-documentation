# Overview of the submission process for biodiversity data to ENA

The following readme provides an overview of the submission process (mainly, but not exclusively) of biodiversity data to ENA as experienced by Data Stewards at the National Bioinfomatics Infrastructure in Sweden (NBIS). The original purpose was to build a knowledge bank with reference material for internal use, but the knowledge can be used as know-how by anyone who wants to submit sequence data, and genome/mitochondrial assemblies to ENA. 

In the first set of examples the descriptions are organised after sub-processes of the larger ENA submission process. Each sub-process is described as a stand alone standard operating procedure (SOP) with extensive information on how-to.

The second set is a list of example submissions of various organisms (those within ERGA/BGE are marked as such), describing the chronological process of submission to ENA as well as descriptions of issues and problems encountered and how they were solved.

The SOP's should be seen as a work in progress, and may be changed, completed, and/or added to in the future.

## List of SOP's:
