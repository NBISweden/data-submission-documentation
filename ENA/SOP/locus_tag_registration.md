# Locus tags for biodiversity projects

This SOP describes how to register a locus tag for assembly submissions to ENA.

## Details

All species in the EBP and ERGA initiatives will aim to have assemblies/annotations submitted. For a functional assembly there must be a locus tag registered for the species prior to the assembly being submitted.

There are two ways to register a locus tag.

1. In the Register Study tab, when filling in elevant information about the study, there is a tickbox for the question: 

`[ ] Will you provide functional genome annotation?` 

If the box is ticked a new tab becomes available below for `Locus Tag Prefix Registration`. Clicking the `Add Locus Tag Prefixes` plus sign, opens a row for entering the suggested locus tag. The [ENA guidelines](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/locus_tags.html) states that a locus tag must follow the below conventions, or it will not be accepted:

*  Must begin with a letter

* All letters must be upper case

* Must from 3 to 12 characters in length

* All characters must be alphanumeric with no diacritics (points or markings on letters, e.g. `รก ร รง`) and none such as `- _ *`

When submitting the study, the suggested locus tag will be registered and become available.

```
Note that a study can have multiple prefixes registered to it, but each prefix can only be registered to a single study. Also note that each prefix can only be registered to a single study; you cannot reuse a prefix from another study, or one which another user has registered.
```

2. If a study already exists but require a locus tag

For studies requiring a locus tag registration after the submission of the study at ENA, a prefix can be added by updating the study. The easiest way to do this is to open the Study registration tab in the browser, check the box:

`[ ] Will you provide functional genome annotation?` 

And then follow the above description.
