# Metadata templates for biodiversity projects (EBP) that do not use the ERGA template

This SOP describes sample metadata registration in biodiversity projects not adhering to the ERGA sample manifest. 

## Details

Some of the biodiversity projects in the EBP umbrella initiative do not apply to the same metadata standard as ERGA (e.g. VR-EBP), yet should still, as flagship initiatives, aim for as high metadata quality as possible.

For ERGA the [metadata sample manifest](https://github.com/ERGA-consortium/ERGA-sample-manifest) is updated by the ERGA consortium. The [EBP standards recommendations](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115639118) does not mention an alternative to the ERGA checklist for similar EBP projects such as the VR-EBP, but a sufficiently close approxiamation would be to use the ENA [Tree of Life (ToL) Checklist](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/programme/tree-of-life/). 

For a continuous comparison and mutual mapping of the two checklists against each other, see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DVNLfth_ve9l_s0UkyigOEyot4GHhO87KV0jAUYPhhY/edit#gid=0).

When opting to use the ToL checklist, all relevant information should be filled, including all mandatory fields as well as the recommended ones. It is advisable, for purpose of enriching the metadata as much as possible, to also make sure as many of the applicable optional fields are filled as well. 

In comparison to the projects using the ERGA manifest, there is no validation step of the metadata in [COPO](https://copo-project.org/), but the metadata is uploaded to ENA in e.g. tsv format.
