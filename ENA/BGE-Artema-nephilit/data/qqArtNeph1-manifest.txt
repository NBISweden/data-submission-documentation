DESCRIPTION	'Artema nephilit was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726). The consensus assembly was checked for contaminants using FCS-GX (version 0.5.5) based on the ALL database released on 2023/01, and purged for haplotypic duplication using purge_dups (version 1.2.5). Yahs (version 1.2a.1) was used to scaffold contigs into chromosomes. The manual curation was done with Sanger-tol/curationpretext (version 1.5), PretextView (version 1.0.4) and Sanger-tol/agp-tpf-utils (commit: 35ea45dbcd8f3ece7a91104e5813541b55beb2ff). The mitochondrial genome could not be assembled using MitoHiFi (3.2.3). The sex system is X1X2 but could not be assigned through synteny.'
