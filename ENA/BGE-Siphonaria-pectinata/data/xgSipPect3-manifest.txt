RUN_REF	ERR12764099, ERR14759141
ASSEMBLYNAME	xgSipPect3.1
ASSEMBLY_TYPE	isolate
COVERAGE	35
PROGRAM	hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726), purge_dups (version 1.2.6), YaHS (version 1.2a.2), NBIS/Earth-Biogenome-Project-pilot (version e6e9c1621b), sanger-tol/blobtoolkit (version 0.9.0)
PLATFORM	PacBio, Illumina
MINGAPLENGTH	100
MOLECULETYPE	genomic DNA
DESCRIPTION	'The assembly was produced with hifiasm using HiFi data. The resulting collapsed *.bp.p_ctg.gfa was selected, screened for contamination with FCS-GX, and purged of haplotigs with purge_dups. Scaffolding was performed with YaHS. The HiC data was not of great use for curation, pairtools reported the fraction frac_cis_40kb+ being 0.042. 75 changes were made using PretextView.'
