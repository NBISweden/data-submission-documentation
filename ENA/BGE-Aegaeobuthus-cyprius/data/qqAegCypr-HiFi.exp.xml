				<LIBRARY_CONSTRUCTION_PROTOCOL>The HiFi library was constructed using the “Preparing whole genome and metagenome libraries using SMRTbell prep kit 3.0” (PN 102-166-600 (April 2022)) from PacBio. DNA was sheared on a Megaruptor 3 (Diagenode) instrument to a target size of 15-20 kb, followed by QC on a Femto Pulse instrument (Agilent). DNA repair, ligation of SMRTbell adapters, post-ligation clean-up and size selection were performed to create a sequencing library. Primer annealing and polymerase binding were performed on the library using the Revio polymerase kit (PN 102-739-100). Finally, one SMRTcell 25M was sequenced on the PacBio Revio System.</LIBRARY_CONSTRUCTION_PROTOCOL>
