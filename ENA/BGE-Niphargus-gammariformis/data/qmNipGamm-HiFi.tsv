DNA was sheared on a Megaruptor 3 (Diagenode) instrument to a target size of 15-20 kb, followed by QC on a Femto Pulse instrument (Agilent). DNA repair, ligation of SMRTbell adapters, post-ligation clean-up and size selection were performed to create a sequencing library. Primer annealing and polymerase binding were performed on the library using the Revio polymerase kit (PN 102-739-100). Finally, one SMRTcell 25M was sequenced on the PacBio Revio System.	-	-					nipGamm_m84045_250516_102155_s1.hifi_reads.bc2289.bam	c4a0cf7b5f9f0b9fd2e2daf597a2fe77
