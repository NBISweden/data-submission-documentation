RUN_REF	ERR15133510, ERR15172555
ASSEMBLYNAME	icProCypr1.1
ASSEMBLY_TYPE	isolate
COVERAGE	61
PROGRAM	Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726), NBIS/Earth-Biogenome-Project-pilot (version: 99c8937), FCS-GX (version 0.5.4), purge_dups (version 1.2.5), YaHS (version 1.2a.2), sanget-tol/curationpretext (version 1.4.2), PretextView (version 1.0.3), sanget-tol/agp-tpf-utils (version 1.2.3)
PLATFORM	PacBio, Illumina
MINGAPLENGTH	100
MOLECULETYPE	genomic DNA
DESCRIPTION	'The assembly was produced with hifiasm in Hi-C mode. The resulting collapsetd *.hic.p_ctg.gfa was selected, screened for contamination with FCS-GX, and purged of haplotigs with purge_dups. Scaffolding was performed with YaHS. The X chromosome was assigned based on MCscan analysis of synteny with another Scarabaeoidea beetle, Melinopterus prodromus (GCA_964023965.1). Mitochondria was assembled with Oatk. PacBio HiFi coverage is 61x and Illumina Hi-C coverage is 27x (after de-duplication).'
