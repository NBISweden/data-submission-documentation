# VR EBP - *Tricholoma matsutake*

## Submission task description
Within the VR-EBP (Earth Biogenome Project) a fungi, *Tricholoma matsutake*, is to be submitted. There are raw reads in form of HiFi, Isoseq and Illumina RNA sequences, an annotated genome assembly and a mito assembly. An umbrella project will be created to collect the two assemblies.

## Procedure overview and links to examples
* [Metadata template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0bnT1SdiVmxTRZ_CiTQAAdvRYDHpZdL/edit#gid=268563316)
* [File locations on Uppmax](/proj/snic2022-6-208/VREBP-Tricholoma_matsutake-2023-AsmAnno/data/to_ENA/)
* Notes on how to [Create EMBL file](https://github.com/NBISweden/annotation-cluster/wiki/ENA-submission#create-embl-file)
* Umbrella project at ENA [how to](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/umbrella.html#umbrella-studies)
* [SOP Umbrella projects](../SOP/register_umbrella_projects.md)

### Steps
* [Collect metadata](#collect-metadata)
* [Submit 3 studies](#register-study) (umbrella, raw reads + genome assembly, mito assembly)
* [Submit sample](#register-sample)
* Prepare and submit [raw reads](#register-experiment)
* Prepare and submit [genome assembly](#genome-assembly)
* Prepare and submit [mito assembly](#mito-assembly)
