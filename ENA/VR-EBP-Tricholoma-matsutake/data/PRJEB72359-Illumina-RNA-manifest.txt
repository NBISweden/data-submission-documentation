DESCRIPTION:	TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation. Sequencing libraries were prepared from 400ng total RNA using the TruSeq stranded mRNA library preparation kit (cat# 20020595, Illumina Inc.) including polyA selection. Unique dual indexes (cat# 20022371, Illumina Inc.) were used. The library preparation was performed according to the manufacturersâ€™ protocol (#1000000040498).
