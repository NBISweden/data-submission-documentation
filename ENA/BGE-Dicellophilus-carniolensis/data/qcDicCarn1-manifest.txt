DESCRIPTION	'The assembly was produced with hifiasm and the *p_ctg.fa was selected. The assembly was decontaminated with FCS-GX, and haplotigs purged with purge_dups. Scaffolding was performed with YaHS. Mitochondria was assembled with Oatk. HiFi and Hi-C data come from distinct individuals. HiFi coverage was 42x and Hi-C coverage was 80x.'
