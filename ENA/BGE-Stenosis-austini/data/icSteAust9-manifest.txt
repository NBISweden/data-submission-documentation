DESCRIPTION	'PacBio HiFi data was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726) in Hi-C mode. The resulting collapsed p_ctg assembly was used as input to the NBIS/Earth-Biogenome-Project-pilot for contamination screening with FCS-GX, haplotig purging with purge_dups, and scaffolding with YaHS. The Hi-C contact maps were generated with sanger-tol/curationpretext and manual curation was done with PretextView and agp-tpf-utils. The raw PacBio HiFi data was downsampled with seqtk (-s 2) to an assembly coverage of 54x. Cis-mapped read coverage for Illumina Hi-C is 270x.'
