DESCRIPTION	'Raw PacBio HiFi data was downsampled to roughly 50x, assembly was produced with hifiasm in Hi-C mode, and the collapsed *.hic.p_ctg.gfa was selected. The assembly was screened for contamination FCS-GX, haplotigs removed with purge_dups, and scaffolded with YaHS. Pretext maps for curation were obtained with sanger-tol/curationpretext and visualised/edited with sanger-tol/pretextview and sanger-tol/agp-tpf-utils. The resulting scaffolds are mostly gapless, with 16 scaffolds matching the known karyotype for this genus (n=16), and containing all of the identified BUSCOs (>99%, hymenoptera_odb10). These likely represent the euchromatic arms of each chromosome, and accordingly most contain telomeric sequences on one end only. The assembly also contains a large number of scaffolds that could not be assigned to chromosomes, likely representing the heterochromatic and highly repetitive fraction of this genome. Mitochondria was assembled with Oatk. The assembly coverage is 50x for PacBio HiFi and 27x for Illumina Hi-C.'
