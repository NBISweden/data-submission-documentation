DESCRIPTION	'Laparocerus anagae was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726) in HiC phasing mode. Contaminations were removed with FCS-GX (version 0.5.5) based on the ALL database released on 2023/01. Remaining haplotypic duplications were identified and removed with purge_dups (version 1.2.6) on both haplotype assemblies. Yahs (version 1.2.2) was used to scaffold contigs into chromosomes. The manual curation was done with PretextView (version 1.0.3) and GRIT_Rapid (git: 1a3d79a8) based on the combined hap1and hap2 assemblies.'
