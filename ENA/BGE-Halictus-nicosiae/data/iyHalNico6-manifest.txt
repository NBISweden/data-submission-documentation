ASSEMBLYNAME	iyHalNico6.1
ASSEMBLY_TYPE	isolate
COVERAGE	55
PROGRAM	Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726), NBIS/Earth-Biogenome-Project-pilot (version: 99c8937), FCS-GX (version 0.5.4), purge_dups (version 1.2.5), YaHS (version 1.2a.2), sanger-tol/curationpretext (version 1.4.2), PretextView (version 1.0.3), sanger-tol/agp-tpf-utils (version 1.2.3)
PLATFORM	PacBio, Illumina
MINGAPLENGTH	100
MOLECULETYPE	genomic DNA
DESCRIPTION	'Raw PacBio HiFi data was downsampled to roughly 55x coverage. The assembly was produced with hifiasm in Hi-C mode, decontaminated with FCS-GX, haplotigs removed with purge_dups, and scaffolded with YaHS. Pretext maps for curation were obtained with sanger-tol/curationpretext and visualised/edited with sanger-tol/pretextview and sanger-tol/agp-tpf-utils. Mitochondria was assembled with Oatk. The assembly coverage is 55x for PacBio HiFi and 126x for Illumina Hi-C.'
