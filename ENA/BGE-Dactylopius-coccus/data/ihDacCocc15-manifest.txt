DESCRIPTION	'Dactylopius coccus was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726). Contaminations were removed with FCS-GX (version 0.5.5) based on the ALL database released on 2023/01 and tiara (version 1.0.3). Remaining haplotypic duplications were identified and removed with purge_dups (version 1.2.6). Yahs (version 1.2.2, with option: --no-contig-ec enabled) was used to scaffold contigs into chromosomes. The manual curation was done with PretextView (version 1.0.3) and GRIT_Rapid (git: 1a3d79a8). Note: The HiC data (ERR15651791) is of low quality (only 258K read pairs span a region of +1Kb), and was only used for pairing four contigs.'
