DESCRIPTION	'Decticus albifrons was assembled with Hifiasm (version 0.25.0-r726). Remaining haplotypic duplications were identified with purge_dups (version 1.2.5), but manually removed in the manual curation step to avoid over purging of highly repetitive genomic regions. Yahs (version 1.2.2) was used to scaffold contigs into chromosomes. The manual curation was done with PretextView (version 1.0.3) and GRIT_Rapid (git: 1a3d79a8).'
