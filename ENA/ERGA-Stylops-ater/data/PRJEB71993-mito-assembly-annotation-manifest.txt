DESCRIPTION: 'To generate the mitochondrial assembly we used the MitoHifi pipeline (Uliano-Silva et al 2023) based on the related mitochondrial reference assembly Xenos yangi (accession: NC_067052) and the HiFi reads as input. This resulted in a suboptimal linear assembly, which was used as a new reference template to align all HiFi reads with PacBio’s pbmm2 aligner. For the longest reads that mapped to the reference template self-align dot blots were created and a single HiFi read was revealed which represented a full length mitochondrialrepresentation. This read was duplicated in order to represent two full passes of the mitochondrial reference. Again all HiFi reads were aligned against this new reference with pbmm2 and 25 of the longest reads that mapped front to end (i.e. maximum number of soft-clipped bases < 2) without any large indels (i.e. indel length < 2 and overall mismatch error rate < 0.5%) were filtered out. These 26 high quality reads were assembled with hifiasm into a full length circular mitochondrial contig. The annotation of the mitochondrial genome was performed using the MITOS2 pipeline on Galaxy (Donath et al 2019), using the invertebrate genetic code with default settings (RefSeq63 Metazoa). This annotation was further complemented with the previous version, MITOS (Bernt et al 2013), which utilizes a different reference sequence database (RefSeq39 + MiTFi tRNA models), MFannot (Lang et al 2023), tRNAscan-SE (Lowe & Eddy, 1997), and ARWEN (Laslett & Canbäck, 2008). The resulting annotations of each gene were aligned with available sequences of six other Strepsiptera species (Dipterophagus daci, NC_058598.1; Mengenilla australiensis, GU188852.1; Mengenilla moldrzyki, NC_018545.1; Xenos peckii, CM079275.1; Xenos vesparum and DQ364229.1; Xenos yangi, NC_067052.1, MW222190.2) from GenBank, and manually checked for start and stop codons, as well as amino acid lengths. When the coordinates for tRNAs provided by MITOS2 differed from those annotated by ARWEN, we prioritized the annotations from ARWEN, as long as the acceptor stem was 6-7 bp. The confirmation of ATP8 was assessed using DeepTMHMM (Hallgren et al 2022) and Quick2D (Zimmermann et al 2018, Gabler et al 2020) to predict transmembrane helices in proteins and compared to ATP8 of other Strepsiptera species. Additionally, HHblits (Remmert et al 2012) was used for further confirmation, as it allows the detection of more distant homologs than BLAST by querying the UniRef30_2023_02 database.'
